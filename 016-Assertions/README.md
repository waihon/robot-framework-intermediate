#Introduction to Assertions

## Purpose: 
Introduce participants to assertions to validate page navigation.

## Learning Objectives:

- Trainees will be able to describe what an assertion is
- Trainees will be able to state which part of the AAA paradigm assert belongs to
- Trainees will be able to identify assertion keywords in library documentation such as SeleniumLibrary’s documentation.

## Challenge: 
Assert that we’re on the Add Invoice page (20 Min)

**Extra Credit:** Make additional verifications that will help you be sure you’re on the right page. Log clear error messages to the report/log files using the verification keywords you’ve chosen to use.
