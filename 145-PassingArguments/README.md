## Purpose: 
The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to pass values to keywords to make them do special things.


## Learning Objectives:

## Challenge: 
Make the "My Log" keyword customized, so that it can print any message you want after 
"This is the message:". For instance, if you use the My Log keyword with the string
"hello world!" the "My Log" keyword would show "This is the message: hello world!"
