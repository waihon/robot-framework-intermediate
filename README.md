## A note on this course
This course was customized for *<CLIENT>* for the Software & QA Leadership team at *<CLIENT>* by Beaufort Fairmont, LLC.

Each exercise correlates to a learning segment in the planned curriculum (starting with “Introduction” and ending with *<EXERCISE-##>*). Each section includes “Purpose” and “Learning Objectives” to help the trainee better understand the curriculum.

Exercise numbering is for internal (Beaufort Fairmont) purposes and identification. Numbering is key in planning and traceability, please do not change exercise numbers.

This document lists exercises in the order they are planned to be delivered. The instructor may have a need to change the ordering during delivery for the benefit of the students and the client.
